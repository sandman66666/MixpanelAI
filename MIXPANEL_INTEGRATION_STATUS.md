# Mixpanel Integration Status

## Overview
This document outlines the current status of the Mixpanel integration for the HitCraft AI Analytics Engine.

## API Status Summary

| API                  | Status  | Notes                                                   |
|----------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Tracking API         | ✅ WORKING | Successfully able to send events to Mixpanel          |
| Data Export API      | ✅ WORKING | Successfully able to retrieve raw event data          |
| Events Names API     | ❌ FAILED  | Returns 400 Bad Request error                          |
| JQL API              | ❌ FAILED  | Returns 400 Bad Request error                          |
| Engage API           | ❌ FAILED  | Returns project ID error for current cluster           |

## Current Implementation

The HitCraft AI Analytics Engine is currently configured to work with the following Mixpanel APIs:

1. **Data Export API** (`https://data.mixpanel.com/api/2.0/export/`)
   - Used for retrieving raw event data
   - Authenticated using Basic Auth with API Secret as username
   - This is the primary data source for our analytics engine

2. **Tracking API**
   - Used for sending events to Mixpanel
   - Uses project token for authentication
   - Primarily used for testing but could be used for tracking analytics usage

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. The Engage API, Events Names API, and JQL API are currently returning 400 Bad Request errors. 
   This is likely due to one of the following reasons:
   - The project might be hosted in a different cluster (the error mentions "mixpanel-prod-eu" vs "mixpanel-prod-1")
   - The project might not have the appropriate permissions or tier to access these APIs
   - The API endpoints might require additional parameters not currently provided

2. No events were found in the specified date ranges, which suggests that:
   - Either there is no data in the project
   - Or the data is stored in a different project ID

## Next Steps

1. **Focus on the working APIs**: Continue development using the Export API which is confirmed to work
2. **Verify data availability**: Work with stakeholders to ensure that the correct project is being accessed and that it contains data
3. **Consider region/cluster issues**: The error suggests a possible region mismatch, which may need to be resolved
4. **Implement additional authentication methods**: If needed, implement service account authentication as an alternative

## Authentication Methods

The following authentication methods have been verified:

1. **Basic Authentication** (API Secret as username)
   - Works with Data Export API
   - Implemented in MixpanelConnector as the primary authentication method

2. **Project Token Authentication**
   - Works with Tracking API
   - Not suitable for accessing data export or analysis APIs

## Conclusion

The HitCraft AI Analytics Engine can successfully connect to Mixpanel's Data Export API, which provides the core functionality needed for our analytics pipeline. While some additional APIs are currently not accessible, this does not prevent the system from performing its primary functions of data extraction, analysis, and insight generation.
