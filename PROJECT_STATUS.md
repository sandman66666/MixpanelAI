### In Progress

1. **Email Notification Service**
   - Templates for daily, weekly, and monthly reports
   - Email delivery service
   - Personalization of insights

### Upcoming Work

1. **API Layer**
   - RESTful endpoints for accessing insights
   - Authentication and security
   - Query capabilities for filtering insights

2. **User Interface**
   - Dashboard for exploring insights
   - Visualization of metrics and trends

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Email Notification Service for delivering insights
2. Create configuration profiles for different types of reports
3. Develop the API layer for programmatic access to insights
4. Begin work on the user interface

## Development Principles

Throughout development, we're adhering to these principles:

1. **Use real data only** - No mock data is used at any stage
2. **Focus on actionability** - Every insight includes specific recommendations
3. **Progressive refinement** - Ensure each component works perfectly before moving on
4. **Data-driven decision making** - Let the data guide the insights, not assumptions
