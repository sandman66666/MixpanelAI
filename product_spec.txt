Example Daily Insight Report
HitCraft Analytics Insights: May 15, 2025

KEY METRICS SUMMARY:
- New Users: 76 (+12% week-over-week)
- Active Users: 689 (-3% week-over-week)
- Productions Completed: 412 (+8% week-over-week)
- Avg Session Duration: 6.8 minutes (+0.2 min week-over-week)

HIGH-IMPACT INSIGHTS:

1. üöÄ GROWTH OPPORTUNITY:
   The "Help me turn my demo into a polished hit" prompt shows 27% higher completion rates than other production prompts. This suggests users are finding particular value in polish/finishing features. Consider featuring this workflow more prominently in the interface and marketing materials.

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è RETENTION RISK:
   New songwriter users show 35% drop-off after their second session if they haven't completed at least one full production. Consider implementing a guided "quick win" experience for new songwriters to ensure early success.

3. üèÜ SUCCESSFUL FEATURE:
   The stem separation feature is showing increasing adoption (+18% week-over-week) with high satisfaction scores. Users who utilize this feature show 42% higher retention at the 30-day mark. Consider expanding promotion of this feature to more user segments.

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

1. Create a targeted email campaign highlighting the demo polishing workflow for intermediate users who haven't tried this feature.

2. Implement an onboarding enhancement to guide new songwriters to complete their first production with fewer steps.

3. A/B test featuring stem separation more prominently in the interface for music producers who haven't discovered this feature.
